                    <span id="italicize">Legal Fiction</span> is a GULC zine of creative work and freeform legal thought,
                    a space where fiction, poetry, art, and ideas can be shared among students and the broader DC community.
                    We are loosely organized and aspirationally quarterly. This is a call for submissions!<br/><br/>
                    What we like: Short fiction about anything at all. Local (campus! DC!) reporting. Poetry. Eye- and chakra-
                    openers. Critiques of the status quo. Visual art. Resilience. Humor. Multimedia works. Homilies
                    from the heart. Tunes. 1-3 sentence book/movie/TV/exhibit reviews. Hybrid forms.<br/><br/>
                    All submissions to: <u>legalfictionzine@gmail.com</u>.
